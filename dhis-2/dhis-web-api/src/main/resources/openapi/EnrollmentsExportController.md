# Get Enrollments

## Specific endpoints

### `getEnrollments`

Get enrollments matching given query parameters.

### `getEnrollmentByUid`

Get an enrollment with given UID.

### `getEnrollmentByUid.parameter.uid`

Get an enrollment with given UID.

### `getEnrollmentByUid.parameter.fields`

Get only the specified fields in the JSON response. This query parameter allows you to remove
unnecessary fields from the response and in some cases decrease the response time. Refer to
https://docs.dhis2.org/en/develop/using-the-api/dhis-core-version-master/metadata.html#webapi_metadata_field_filter
for how to use it.

## Common for all endpoints

### `*.parameter.EnrollmentRequestParams.enrolledAfter`

Get enrollments with an enrollment date after the given date and time. This parameter is inclusive, 
so results with the exact date and time specified will be included in the response.

### `*.parameter.EnrollmentRequestParams.enrolledBefore`

Get enrollments with an enrollment date before the given date and time. This parameter is inclusive, 
so results with the exact date and time specified will be included in the response.

### `*.parameter.EnrollmentRequestParams.enrollments`

`<enrollment1-uid>[,<enrollment2-uid>...]`

Get enrollments with given UID(s). Multiple enrollment UIDs can be specified by separating them 
with commas.

### `*.parameter.EnrollmentRequestParams.followUp`

Get enrollments with the given follow-up status. When set to true, only enrollments marked for 
follow-up will be returned. When set to false, only enrollments not marked for follow-up will be 
returned.

### `*.parameter.EnrollmentRequestParams.includeDeleted`

Get soft-deleted enrollments by specifying `includeDeleted=true`. Soft-deleted enrollments are
excluded by default.

### `*.parameter.EnrollmentRequestParams.orgUnits`

`<orgUnit1-uid>[,<orgUnit2-uid>...]`

Get enrollments owned by given organisation units in `orgUnits` parameter relative to the 
`orgUnitMode` parameter.

- When `orgUnitMode=SELECTED` - or no `orgUnitMode` is specified (default) - the enrollments 
  owned by the `orgUnits` are returned.
- When `orgUnitMode=CHILDREN` the enrollments owned by the `orgUnits` or by the `orgUnits` direct
  children are returned.
- When `orgUnitMode=DESCENDANTS` the enrollments owned by the `orgUnits` or any of its descendants
  are returned.
- When `orgUnitMode=ALL`, `orgUnitMode=CAPTURE` or `orgUnitMode=ACCESSIBLE` the `orgUnits` parameter
  is not allowed.

### `*.parameter.EnrollmentRequestParams.orgUnitMode`

Get enrollments using the given organisation unit selection mode.

- When `orgUnitMode=SELECTED`, `orgUnitMode=CHILDREN` or `orgUnitMode=DESCENDANTS`, the `orgUnits`
  parameter is required to specify which enrollments to return.
- When `orgUnitMode=ALL` enrollments will be returned irrespective of the organization unit they
  are owned by. To use this parameter, the user needs the `Search Tracked entity in all org units`
  authority.
- When `orgUnitMode=ACCESSIBLE` enrollments owned by any organisation unit in the user's 
  effective search scope will be returned. Effective search scope is the union of user's defined 
  search scope and capture scope.
- When `orgUnitMode=CAPTURE` enrollments that have an enrollment organisation unit in the user's 
  capture scope will be returned.

### `*.parameter.EnrollmentRequestParams.program`

Get enrollments from the specified tracker program.

### `*.parameter.EnrollmentRequestParams.status`

Get enrollments with the specified status.

### `*.parameter.EnrollmentRequestParams.programStatus`

Get enrollments with the given status.

**DEPRECATED as of 2.42:** Use parameter `status` instead.

See `status` for details on valid statuses.

### `*.parameter.EnrollmentRequestParams.trackedEntityType`

Get enrollments of tracked entities of the specified tracked entity type. 

### `*.parameter.EnrollmentRequestParams.trackedEntity`

Get enrollments of the tracked entity with the specified UID. 

### `*.parameter.EnrollmentRequestParams.updatedAfter`

Get enrollments updated after the given date and time. An enrollment is considered updated if 
any of its attributes, events or relationships have been modified. This parameter is inclusive, so 
results with the exact date and time specified will be included in the response.

### `*.parameter.EnrollmentRequestParams.updatedWithin`

Get enrollments updated within the given ISO-8601 duration. An enrollment is considered updated 
if any of its attributes, events or relationships have been modified.

### `*.parameter.EnrollmentRequestParams.order`

`<propertyName1:sortDirection>[,<propertyName2:sortDirection>...]`

Get enrollments in given order. Enrollments can be ordered by the following case-sensitive
properties:

* `completedAt`
* `createdAt`
* `createdAtClient`
* `enrolledAt`
* `updatedAt`
* `updatedAtClient`

Valid `sortDirection`s are `asc` and `desc`. `sortDirection` is case-insensitive. `sortDirection`
defaults to `asc` for properties without explicit `sortDirection` as in `order=enrolledAt`.

Enrollments are ordered by newest (internal id desc) by default meaning when no `order` parameter is
provided.

### `*.parameter.EnrollmentRequestParams.fields`

Get only the specified fields in the JSON response. This query parameter allows you to remove
unnecessary fields from the JSON response and in some cases decrease the response time. Refer to
https://docs.dhis2.org/en/develop/using-the-api/dhis-core-version-master/metadata.html#webapi_metadata_field_filter
for how to use it.
