/**
 * This annotation is used within a Docker-based integration test to inject data
 * into the Dockerized Postgresql database. The annotation expects a "path"
 * property to point to the actual SQL file containing the INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
 * statements to run prior to each test. The file must be present in the
 * classpath (e.g. src/main/resources/) The data file is going to be injected
 * only once per each test class.
