/**
 * A DeletionHandler should override methods for objects that, when deleted,
 * will affect the current object in any way. Eg. a DeletionHandler for
 * DataElementGroup should override the deleteDataElement(..) method which
 * should remove the DataElement from all DataElementGroups. Also, it should
 * override the allowDeleteDataElement() method and return a non-null String
 * value if there exists objects that are dependent on the DataElement and are
 * considered not be deleted. The return value could be a hint for which object
 * is denying the delete, like the name.
