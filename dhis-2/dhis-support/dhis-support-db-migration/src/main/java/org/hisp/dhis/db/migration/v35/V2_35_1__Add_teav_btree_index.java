/**
 * This Java migration changes the data type of the 'value' column in
 * trackedentityattributevalue table to varchar(1200). Additionally we put a
 * btree index on the same table, to improve performance of lookup. This
 * upograde will fail is any value in the table exceeds 1200 characters. Due to
 * this, we catch any SQLException and write a custom message, including a link
 * to a community.dhis2.org post explaining this upgrade, and how to deal with
 * any upgrade failures.
 * <p>
 * By setting canExecuteInTransaction to false, we let this upgrade run outside
 * the main flow of flyway, allowing us to ignore that the upgrade potentially
 * fails.
