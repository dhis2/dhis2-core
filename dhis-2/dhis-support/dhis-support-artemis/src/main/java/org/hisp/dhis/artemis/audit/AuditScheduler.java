/**
 * Buffers Audit messages prior to sending them to the Audit queue. This
 * scheduler is disabled by default (config key: audit.inmemory-queue.enabled)
 * and should be used only in very high-traffic environments. Note that upon a
 * JVM crash, the Audit messages in this queue will be lost.
 *
 * The buffer is based on a {@link DelayQueue} where messages are buffered for 5
 * seconds, before being de-queued to the Artemis broker.
 *
 * To avoid excessive memory pressure, max 200 messages can stay in the queue:
 * in-excess messages are processed immediately.
