/**
 * An abstract class that have sub classes representing any number of options
 * for one or more ValueTypes e.g. {@link ValueType}.FILE_RESOURCE
 *
 * <p>
 * The sub classes will be serialized and persisted with Hibernate as a jsonb
 * Postgres value type, with the field <strong>'type'</strong> as the sub class
 * discriminator field, see: {@link JsonTypeInfo#property()} below.
 *
 * <p>
 * See {@link org.hisp.dhis.hibernate.jsonb.type.SafeJsonBinaryType} for the
 * implementation of the custom Hibernate value type representing this object as
 * the jsonb value type in Postgres.
 *
 * <p>
 * To make a new option class, extend this class and add a
 * {@link com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonSubTypes.Type} line in the
 * {@link JsonSubTypes#value()} list in this file. Point to the implementation
 * in the {@link JsonSubTypes.Type#value()} attribute and what discriminator
 * value it has in the {@link JsonSubTypes.Type#name()} attribute. The new
 * option class must be annotated with {@link JsonTypeName#value()} and have the
 * same value as the: {@link JsonSubTypes.Type#name()} attribute in this file.
 *
 * <p>
 * See: {@link FileTypeValueOptions} for an example of a sub class of this file.
 *
 * <p>
 * See {@link org.hisp.dhis.dataelement.DataElement} for an example of a class
 * that uses ValueTypeOptions to complement it's ValueType.
