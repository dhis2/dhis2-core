/**
 * {@link Job}s are tasks that are supposed to run asynchronously.
 *
 * A {@link JobConfiguration} is a specific configuration for running such a
 * task.
 *
 * There should be one {@link JobConfiguration} for each {@link JobType} and
 * only one task of each {@link JobType} can run at the same time.
 *
 * Usually a {@link Job}'s execution is scheduled by using
 * {@link #schedule(JobConfiguration)} or
 * {@link #scheduleWithStartTime(JobConfiguration, Date)}.
 *
 * Alternatively a execution can be ran ad-hoc using
 * {@link #executeNow(JobConfiguration)}.
 *
 * There are ways to schedule a task for future execution:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Cron expression ({@link SchedulingType#CRON}):</dt>
 * <dd>To {@link #schedule(JobConfiguration)} a task in a reoccurring time
 * pattern</dd>
 * <dt>Fixed delay time ({@link SchedulingType#FIXED_DELAY}):</dt>
 * <dd>To {@link #schedule(JobConfiguration)} a task in a fixed interval</dd>
 * <dt>Start time based:</dt>
 * <dd>To {@link #scheduleWithStartTime(JobConfiguration, Date)} a task once at
 * a specific point in time.</dd>
