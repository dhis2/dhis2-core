/**
 * Interface for scheduling jobs.

 * The main steps of the scheduling:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create a job configuration {@link JobConfiguration}</li>
 * <li>This job configuration needs a job specific parameters object {@link JobParameters}, ie {@link org.hisp.dhis.scheduling.parameters.AnalyticsJobParameters}.</li>
 * <li>Call scheduleJob with the job configuration.</li>
 * <li>The schedulingManager calls the spring scheduler with a runnable object {@link JobInstance}.</li>
 * <li>When the cron expression occurs the job will try to execute from the runnable object, job instance.</li>
 * </ul>
