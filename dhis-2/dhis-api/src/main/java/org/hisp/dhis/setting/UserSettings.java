 * {@linkplain UserSettings} are bound to the user session.

 * hold data of settings defined in the DB a {@linkplain UserSettings} instance only holds
 * key-value-pairs for settings either defined as user setting in the DB or as system setting
 * fallback. Keys that are not defined in DB use the default provided through their access method.
 *
 * <p>The only exception are individual request that make an override using {@link
 * ThreadUserSettings#put(Map)}.
 *
 * <p>For that reason user has to log out and re-login to make changes to system or user settings
 * visible in the session. This choice is made to balance complexity, predictability and resource
 * costs while providing a clear flow for users.
