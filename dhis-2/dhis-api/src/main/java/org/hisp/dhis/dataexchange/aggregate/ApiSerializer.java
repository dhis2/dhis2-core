 * Jackson JSON serializer for {@link Api}. Does not write sensitive properties

 * This serializer exists because {@link Api} is persisted as a JSONB data type
 * which relies on creating a deep copy by writing and reading the class to
 * JSON, in which case the use of {@link JsonProperty.Access.WRITE_ONLY} at the
 * property level leads to the property value being lost in the copy process.
