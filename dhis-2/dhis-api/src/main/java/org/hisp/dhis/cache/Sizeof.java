/**
 * {@link Sizeof} is a operator that given an object returns the estimated size
 * of this object in bytes. Can estimate the size of a particular type.
 *
 * To be efficient in the estimation of objects a {@link Sizeof} is composed
 * based on the {@link Class} metadata available for given object type. This
 * composed operator will have a part that is determined once when statically
 * analysing a certain {@link Class} and might have a dynamic part for those
 * parts of an object that do not allow static analysis. An example would be a
 * field of type {@link Object} which could hold any actual object. In such a
 * case the analysis would resolve the {@link Sizeof} operator dynamically for
 * the actual {@link Class} of the present value.
