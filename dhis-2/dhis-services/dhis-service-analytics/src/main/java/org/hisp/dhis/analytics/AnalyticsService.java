/**
 * This interface is responsible for retrieving aggregated data. Data will be
 * returned in a grid object or as a dimensional key-value mapping.
 * <p>
 * Most objects accept a DataQueryParams object which encapsulates the query
 * parameters. The dimensions in the response will appear in the same order as
 * they are set on the DataQueryParams object. You can use various methods for
 * setting indicators, data elements, data sets, periods, organisation units,
 * categories, data element group sets and organisation unit group sets on the
 * the DataQueryParams object. Objects can be defined as dimensions or filters.
 * <p>
 * Example usage for setting multiple indicators and a period as dimensions and
 * an organisation unit as filter. In the grid response the first column will
 * contain indicator identifiers, the second column will contain period
 * identifiers and the third column will contain aggregated values. Note that
 * the organisation unit is excluded since it is defined as a filter:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * DataQueryParams params = new DataQueryParams();
 *
 * params.setIndicators( indicators );
 * params.setPeriod( period );
 * params.setFilterOrganisationUnit( organisationUnit );
 *
 * Grid grid = analyticsService.getAggregatedDataValues( params );
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The returned grid has a metaData object which contains metadata about the
 * response, such as a mapping between the UIDs and names of metadata objects.
 * For valid keys refer to the key property of {@link AnalyticsMetaDataKey}.</p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage for including category option combos in the response. Note that
 * the index position of category option combos will follow the order of when
 * the enableCategoryOptionCombos method was called. In the map response, the
 * keys will represent the dimensions defined in the DataQueryParams object and
 * will contain dimension identifiers separated by the "-" character. The key
 * will be of type String and contain a data element identifier, a category
 * option combo identifier and an organisation unit identifier in that order.
 * The map values will be the aggregated values of type Double:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * DataQueryParams params = DataQueryParams.newBuilder();
 *      .withDataElements( deA, deB )
 *      .withOrganisationUnits( ouA, ouB )
 *      .withFilterPeriods( peA, peB )
 *      .build();
 *
 * Map<String, Double> map = analyticsService.getAggregatedDataValueMapping( params );
 * }
 * </pre>
