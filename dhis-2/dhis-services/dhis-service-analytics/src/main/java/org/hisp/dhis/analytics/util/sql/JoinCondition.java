/**
 * Functional interface for building SQL JOIN conditions. The interface takes a table alias and
 * returns the corresponding JOIN condition.
 *
 * <p>Examples:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Simple join on id
 * JoinCondition idJoin = alias -> alias + ".user_id = users.id";
 * // Usage: "LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.user_id = users.id"
 *
 * // Join with multiple conditions
 * JoinCondition activeUserJoin = alias ->
 *     alias + ".user_id = users.id AND " +
 *     alias + ".status = 'ACTIVE'";
 * // Usage: "LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.user_id = users.id AND o.status = 'ACTIVE'"
 *
 * // Join with date range
 * JoinCondition dateRangeJoin = alias ->
 *     alias + ".start_date <= CURRENT_DATE AND " +
 *     alias + ".end_date >= CURRENT_DATE";
 * // Usage: "LEFT JOIN periods p ON p.start_date <= CURRENT_DATE AND p.end_date >= CURRENT_DATE"
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Typical usage in SelectBuilder:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * SelectBuilder builder = new SelectBuilder()
 *     .from("users", "u")
 *     .leftJoin("orders", "o", alias -> alias + ".user_id = u.id");
 * }</pre>
