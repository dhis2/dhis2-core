  /**
   * Removes surrounding quotes (double quotes <code>"</code> or backticks <code>`</code>) from a
   * string. If the string is not quoted or the quotes do not match, the original string is returned
   * unchanged.
   *
   * <p><b>Behavior:</b>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Returns an empty string if the input is <code>null</code> or empty.
   *   <li>Returns the original string if it is too short to have matching quotes (less than 2
   *       characters).
   *   <li>Removes quotes only if the first and last characters are matching quotes (either <code>"
   *       </code> or <code>`</code>).
   *   <li>Returns the original string if the quotes do not match or if the string is not quoted.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><b>Examples:</b>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li><code>unquote("\"quoted\"")</code> returns <code>"quoted"</code>
   *   <li><code>unquote("`backticked`")</code> returns <code>"backticked"</code>
   *   <li><code>unquote("not quoted")</code> returns <code>"not quoted"</code>
   *   <li><code>unquote("\"mismatch`")</code> returns <code>"\"mismatch`"</code>
   *   <li><code>unquote("")</code> returns <code>""</code>
   *   <li><code>unquote(null)</code> returns <code>""</code>
   * </ul>
   *
   * @param quoted The string from which to remove quotes. Can be <code>null</code> or empty.
   * @return The string without surrounding quotes, or the original string if it is not quoted.
   *     Returns an empty string if the input is <code>null</code> or empty.
