 * A utility class for joining multiple SQL conditions into a single WHERE clause. This class is

  /**
   * Joins multiple SQL conditions into a single WHERE clause, separated by the <code>AND</code>
   * operator. Conditions that are null, empty, or consist solely of whitespace are ignored.
   *
   * <p><b>Behavior:</b>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Returns an empty string if no valid conditions are provided (null, empty, or all
   *       conditions are blank).
   *   <li>Removes leading "WHERE" or " where" from individual conditions before joining.
   *   <li>Joins valid conditions with the <code>AND</code> operator.
   *   <li>Adds a "WHERE" prefix to the final result if at least one valid condition is present.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><b>Examples:</b>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li><code>joinSqlConditions("column1 = 1", "column2 = 2")</code> returns <code>
   *       "where column1 = 1 and column2 = 2"</code>
   *   <li><code>joinSqlConditions("where column1 = 1", "where column2 = 2")</code> returns <code>
   *       "where column1 = 1 and column2 = 2"</code>
   *   <li><code>joinSqlConditions("", null, "column1 = 1")</code> returns <code>"where column1 = 1"
   *       </code>
   *   <li><code>joinSqlConditions()</code> returns <code>""</code>
   *   <li><code>joinSqlConditions(null, "", "   ")</code> returns <code>""</code>
   * </ul>
   *
   * @param conditions The SQL conditions to join. Can be null, empty, or contain null/blank
   *     strings.
   * @return A single WHERE clause combining the valid conditions with <code>AND</code> operators.
   *     Returns an empty string if no valid conditions are provided.
