 * Represents a basic SQL condition string without any transformation. Unlike {@link Condition.Raw},

 * <p>Examples:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Basic conditions
 * new SimpleCondition("active = true")
 *     -> "active = true"
 *
 * // Comparison operations
 * new SimpleCondition("age >= 18")
 *     -> "age >= 18"
 *
 * // IN clauses
 * new SimpleCondition("status IN ('ACTIVE', 'PENDING')")
 *     -> "status IN ('ACTIVE', 'PENDING')"
 *
 * // LIKE patterns
 * new SimpleCondition("name LIKE 'John%'")
 *     -> "name LIKE 'John%'"
 *
 * // Complex conditions
 * new SimpleCondition("(age >= 18 AND status = 'ACTIVE')")
 *     -> "(age >= 18 AND status = 'ACTIVE')"
