/**
 * Tracker exporter APIs allow ordering by different types. For example events can be ordered by
 * field names, {@link DataElement} and {@link TrackedEntityAttribute}. It is crucial for the order
 * values to stay in one collection as their order needs to be kept as provided by the user. We
 * cannot come up with a type-safe type that captures the above order features and that can be used
 * in a generic collection such as a List (see typesafe heterogeneous container). We therefore use
 * {@link Order} with a field of type {@link Object}. We get compile time type safety via methods
 * such as {@code orderBy(DataElement, SortDirection)}. This allows us to advocate the types that
 * can be ordered by while storing the order in a single {@code List} of {@link Order}. Runtime type
 * checks are then used to ensure users (and developers) get meaningful error messages in case they
 * order by unsupported fields or types.
