/**
 * Package validation takes a potentially invalid user payload
 * ({@link org.hisp.dhis.tracker.bundle.TrackerBundle} in and runs all our
 * {@link org.hisp.dhis.tracker.validation.Validator}s attributing errors and
 * warnings to entities {@link org.hisp.dhis.tracker.domain.TrackerDto} in the
 * payload. {@link org.hisp.dhis.tracker.validation.ValidationService} is the
 * main entry point into this package. The result of the validation is a
 * {@link org.hisp.dhis.tracker.validation.ValidationResult} that contains a
 * list of errors and a list of warnings both of them exposed as
 * {@link org.hisp.dhis.tracker.validation.Validation}s. The
 * {@link org.hisp.dhis.tracker.validation.ValidationResult}s tracked entities,
 * enrollments, events and relationships can be persisted (created, updated,
 * deleted) and thus trusted to be in a valid state.
