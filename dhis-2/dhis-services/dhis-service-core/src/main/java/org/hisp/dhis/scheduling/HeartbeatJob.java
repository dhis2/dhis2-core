/**
 * Performs small general signal calls to perform updates that need to be maintained every n
 * seconds.
 *
 * <p>The reason this is better placed in this job than to execute it directly with an {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService} is to have it in sync with the general scheduling loop.
 *
 * <p>The second good reason is that using jobs can utilise the {@link JobProgress} tracking to
 * improve error handling and visibility without making it complicated.
