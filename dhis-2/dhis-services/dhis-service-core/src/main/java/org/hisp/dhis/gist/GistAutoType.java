/**
 * {@link GistAutoType}s is a gist configuration that control which fields the
 * {@code :all} / {@code *} preset will include and which {@link Transform} is
 * used by default on included collection fields.
 *
 * The default {@link GistAutoType} depends on the endpoint different used:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code /api/{object-type}/gist} uses {@link GistAutoType#S}</li>
 * <li>{@code /api/{object-type}/{uid}/gist} uses {@link GistAutoType#L}</li>
 * <li>{@code /api/{object-type}/{uid}/{property}/gist} uses
 * {@link GistAutoType#M}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Users can override this default using the {@code auto} parameter.
 *
 * This can be understood as the user's "master-switch" to control how short the
 * gist should be.
 *
 * The reason to use different settings depending on the endpoint is to scale
 * the size of the resulting list items to match the purpose of the list/view
 * better. Main list are shortest, property lists a bit more detailed and a
 * single object view is most detailed.
