/**
 * Adopter interface to read {@link DataValueSet}s from different input formats
 * like XML, JSON and CSV.
 *
 * To avoid materialising a potentially very large set of
 * {@link org.hisp.dhis.dxf2.datavalue.DataValue}s with the {@link DataValueSet}
 * the values are not included in the {@link #readHeader()} value. Instead, the
 * values are iterated/streamed using the {@link #readNext()} method.
 *
 * To read an input the call sequence should be the following:
 * <ol>
 * <li>call {@link #readHeader()} once (must be called)</li>
 * <li>call {@link #readNext()} until it returns {@code null}</li>
 * <li>call {@link #close()} once</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * All methods might throw an {@link java.io.UncheckedIOException}.
 *
 * A reader that does not support actual streaming using {@link #readNext()} can
 * include the values in the {@link DataValueSet} returned by the
 * {@link #readHeader()} and immediately return {@code null} when
 * {@link #readNext()} is called.
