severity: WARNING
introduction: >
  User roles should generally have some authorities assigned to them. A valid case for a user role with
  no authorities would be for users which need to be restricted from accessing any data or functionality.
  It is also possible that user roles may have been created without any authorities assigned by mistake.
  Another possibility is that due to changes in the system, authorities may have been removed automatically.
recommendation: >
  Using the details provided, review the user roles which have no authorities assigned and consider whether
    they should have authorities assigned. If they should have authorities assigned, assign the appropriate
    authorities to the user roles. If they should not have authorities assigned, consider whether the user roles
    are necessary and if not, delete them.
