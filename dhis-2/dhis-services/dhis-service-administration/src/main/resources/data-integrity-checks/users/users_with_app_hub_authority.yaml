introduction: >
  Users who have permissions to access the DHIS2 App Hub are able to install and manage apps available in
  DHIS2. Users may be able to install apps which have not been vetted by system administrators,
  potentially introducing security risks to the system. Updating existing apps may unintentionally break
  functionality if the updates are not properly tested. Removing existing apps may also break
  core business processes relying on those apps.
  It is recommended to regularly review users with access to manage apps to ensure that only trusted users
  have this level of access.
recommendation: >
  Using the list of users provided by the details query, consider whether these users should have the App Hub authority
  assigned. If they should not have the App Hub authority, consider removing it from their user roles.
