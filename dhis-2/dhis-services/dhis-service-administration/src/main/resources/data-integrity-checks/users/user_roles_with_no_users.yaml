description: User roles which have no users assigned.
section: Users

summary_sql: >-
    SELECT COUNT(*) as value, 
    100.0 * COUNT(*) / NULLIF((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM userrole), 0) as percent
    FROM userrole
    WHERE userroleid NOT IN (SELECT userroleid FROM userrolemembers);

details_id_type: userRoles
severity: WARNING
introduction: >
    User roles should generally have some users assigned to them. A valid case for a user role with
    no users would be for user roles which are newly created and have not yet been assigned to any users.
    It is also possible that user roles may have been created without any users assigned by mistake.
    Some user roles may have also been in use at some point in time, but are no longer in use.
recommendation: >
    Using the details provided, review the user roles which have no users assigned and consider whether
    they should have users assigned. If they should have users assigned, assign the appropriate
    users to the user roles. If they should not have users assigned, consider whether the user roles
    are necessary and if not, delete them.
