severity: WARNING
introduction: >
  In current versions of DHIS2, users are required to have a username that is between 4 and 255 characters long and
    contains only letters, numbers, and the characters `@`, `.`, `-`, and `_`.  Additionally, the username should
  not end with any of these characters.
recommendation: >
  Using the list of users provided by the details query, consider to create a new user for the user with an invalid
  username. It is currently not possible to update a user's username in DHIS2, so a new user will need to be created
  for the user with the invalid username.
