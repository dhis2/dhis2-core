introduction: >
    Classifying program rules by priority may be used to determine the order in which 
    they are evaluated. Program rules with no priority have no defined order and may
    not be evaluated as expected.
recommendation: >
    Using the DHIS2 user interface, assign a priority to each of the program rules
    which is missing one. Alternatively, if the program rule is not in use, then
    consider removing it.
