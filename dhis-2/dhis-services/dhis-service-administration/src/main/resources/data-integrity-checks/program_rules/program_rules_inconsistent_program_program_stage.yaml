introduction: >
  Program rules can be linked to both a program as well as a program stage.
  If the program rule is linked to a program stage, it should also be linked to the
  program that the program stage belongs to. This check identifies program rules that are linked to a program stage
    but not to the program that the program stage belongs to.
