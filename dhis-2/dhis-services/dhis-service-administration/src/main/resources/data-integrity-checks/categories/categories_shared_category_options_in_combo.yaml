severity: SEVERE
introduction: >
    As a general rule, category options should be reused where possible between categories. The exception
    to this rule however, is when you have a category combo with multiple categories, and within those
    categories, a category option is shared. As a simple example, lets say you have a category called "Sex" with
    options "Male"", "Female" and "Unknown". There is also a second category called "Age" with options "<15", "15+",
    and "Unknown". A category combination called "Age/Sex" is then created with these two categories, which share
    the option "Unknown". This situation should be avoided, as it creates issues when analyzing data.
details_id_type: categoryCombos
recommendation: >
    The recommended approach to dealing with this situation is to create a new category combination, using two new categories.
    Using the example from the introduction, you should create two new category options called "Unknown age" and "Unknown sex".
    A new category combination can then be created with these new categories, which do not share category options.
    All data which is potentially associated with the old category combinations, would need to be reassigned
    to the new category option combinations. Any analytical objects which use the categories to be removed
    would also need to be updated.
