introduction: >
  Categories can be enabled as data dimensions. 
  This is useful for generating sub-totals for category combos
  which consist of more than one category. For each category 
  which is enabled as a dimension, a column in the analytics 
  tables is created and then indexed. If many categories
  are enabled as a dimensions, this may lead to an increase 
  in the amount of time which is required to export the analytics tables.
  If the category is never used for any analytical purpose (map, chart, table, etc)
  or to generate sub-totals in a data set report,
  then there is little point to enable it as a dimension.

recommendation: >
  Review the list of categories which have been flagged by this integrity check
  and consider whether they are actually needed as dimensions. If they are not
  needed, then disable them as dimensions. If they are needed, then create
  visualizations which use them. Categories can always be re-enabled as dimensions
  if they are needed once again.
