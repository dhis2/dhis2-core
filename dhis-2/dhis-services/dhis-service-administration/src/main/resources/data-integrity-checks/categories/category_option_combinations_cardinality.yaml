severity: SEVERE
introduction: >
    All category option combinations should have exactly the same number of category option associations
    as the number of categories in the category combination. If there are two categories in a category
    combination, then every category option combination should have exactly two category options.
    
    Category option combinations with the incorrect cardinality are usually the result of a category
    combination having been created, and then modified later. Suppose that two categories are used 
    to create a category combination. Each category option combination of this category combo will 
    have two category options. If an additional category is added to the category combination later,
    new category option combinations with three category options will be created and associated
    with this category combo. The original category option combinations would be considered to be
    invalid.
details_id_type: categoryOptionCombos
recommendation: >
    Category option combinations which have an incorrect cardinality will be ignored by the DHIS2
    analytics system and should be removed.
