  severity: WARNING
  introduction: >
     Category combinations which are unused in any datasets, data elements, programs or data approval workflows may be safe
     to delete. In some cases, category combinations may be created, but never actually used for anything. This may lead
     to situations where users and implementers are confused about which category combination should actually be used.
     In general, it should be safe to delete unused category combinations, except in situations where existing data
     has been associated with them.
  details_id_type: categoryCombos
  recommendation: >
     Check to see if any data is associated with the category combination before attempting to delete it. Category combinations
     which are not currently used in any metadata objects may still be valid for legacy reasons, but they should be reviewed
     to be sure they are still needed. Otherwise, it should be safe to remove them from the system.
