introduction: >
  The default category option in DHIS2 is used as a special category option
  throughout the system. It should be publicly shared with all users.
details_id_type: categoryOptions
recommendation: >
  Recent versions of DHIS2 prevent modification of the default category option's sharing
  attributes. The only way to fix this issue is to manually update the default category
  in the database. You can use the following SQL query as a basis to update the sharing. 
  As is always the case when modifying the database directly, make sure to back up your
  database before running the query.
  ```sql
  UPDATE categoryoption
  SET publicaccess = 'rwrw----', sharing = '{"public":"rwrw----","external":"r--------","userGroupAccesses":[]}'
  WHERE name = 'default';
  ```
