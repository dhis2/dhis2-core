  introduction: >
    All category option combinations should be associated with a category combo.
    In certain cases, when category combinations are deleted,the linkage between
    a category option combination and a category combination may become corrupted.
  details_id_type: categoryOptionCombos
  recommendation: >
    Check if any data is associated with the category option combination in question. Likely,
    the data should either be deleted or migrated to a valid category option combination.
    Any data which is associated with any of these category option combinations will
    not be available through either the data entry modules or any of the analytical apps.
