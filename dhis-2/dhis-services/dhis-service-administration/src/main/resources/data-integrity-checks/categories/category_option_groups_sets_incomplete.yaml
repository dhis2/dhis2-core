introduction: >
  Category option group sets are composed of multiple category option groups, which are in turn composed of various category
  options. Category option group sets are often used to group related category options together for analytical purposes. 
  Categories are also composed of category options. In general, but not always, category option group sets should contain 
  all category options of related categories. Suppose we have the following two age categories. 
  
  Age coarse: <15, 15+
  Age fine: <1, 1-10, 10-14,15-19,20-24,25-29,30-34,35-39,40-44,45+
  
  In many cases, related data elements may be disaggregated differently. This may be to differences in the way
  in which the data is collected, or as is often the case, the disaggregation has changed over time. If we 
  wish to analyze data for two different data elements (one of which uses Age coarse and the other Age fine), we
  can create a category option group set consisting of two category option groups which should consist
  of the following category options from above. 
  
  <15: <15, <1, 1-10, 10-14
  15+: 15+, 15-19,20-24,25-29,30-34,35-39,40-44,45+
  
  Suppose that we happen to omit the category option "<1" from the "<15" category option group. This would
  result in potential aggregation errors in when using this category option group set in any analytical 
  objects. The details of this metadata check would return the UID and name of the category option group
  set. The category and category option would also be provided. Using the previous example, we would
  see "Age fine:{<1}" in the metadata check details section, to indicate that the <1 category option
  which is part of the "Age fine" category, is missing from the category option group set.
  
  There may exist specific analytical reasons why specific category options are omitted from a category option group set. 
  However,these should usually be special cases. This metadata check will identify cases where category option group
  sets appear to be incomplete, however you should carefully review any groups which appear in the details. 
  
  This check may also produce a number of issues which may at first glance appear to be false positives. In some
  cases, category options may be added to a category by mistake. When category option group sets are created,
  this extraneous option may be omitted and thus appear as missing from the group set. 
  
  Another observed situation is where an option like "Unknown" is used across unrelated categories. Suppose you 
  have two categories "Age (<15, 15+, Unknown)" and "Sex (Male,Female,Unknown)". Similar to above, we create
  category option group sets like: 
  
  <15: <15
  15+: 15+
  Unknown: Unknown
  
  This metadata check will report that "Male" and "Female" are missing from the group set. This is because the
  same "Unknown" option is shared between two different, unrelated categories. It is recommended  that if this 
  situation occurs, that you create two separate "Unknown" category options like "Unknown sex" and "Unknown age". 

recommendation: >
  Using the maintenance app, assign the missing category options to an appropriate category option group
  within the affected category option group set.
