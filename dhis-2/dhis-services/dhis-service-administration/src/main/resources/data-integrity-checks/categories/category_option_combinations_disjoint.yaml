  introduction: >
    Under certain circumstances, category option combinations may exist in the system, but not have any direct
    association with category options which are associated with their category combination. This situation
    usually occurs when category options have been added to a category and then the category is added
    to a category combination. New category option combinations are created in the system at this point.
    If any of the category options are then removed in one of the underlying categories, a so-called disjoint
    category option combination may result. This is a category option combination which has no direct
    association with any category options in any of the categories associated with the category combination.
  recommendation: >
    The disjoint category option combinations should be removed from the system if possible. However,
    if any data is associated with the category option combination, a determination will need to be
    made in regards of how to deal with this data.
