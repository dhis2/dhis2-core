introduction: >
  This check will find all category option combinations that do not have a name. Category option
  combinations should have a name to help identify them. Normally, names for category option combinations
  should be automatically generated based on the category options that are associated with the category
  but it is possible to manually set the name for a category option combination either via the API
  or directly in the database. Category option combinations with no names should be reviewed to
  determine if the name should be set or if the category option combination should be removed.
recommendation: >
  Review the category option combinations with no names and set the name for the category option
  combination. If the category option combination is not needed, it should be removed. Alternatively,
  the name can be set to a value which is more meaningful to the user.
