  severity: WARNING
  introduction: >
    Categories with the exact same category options should be considered
    to be merged. Categories with the exact same category options
    may be easily confused by users in analysis. The details view will
    provide a list of categories which have the exact same category options.
    For each duplicated category a number in parentheses such as (1) will
    indicate which categories belong to duplicated groups.
  details_id_type: categories
  recommendation: |
    If category combinations have already been created with duplicative categories,
    it is recommended that you do not take any action, but rather ensure
    that users understand that there may be two category combinations which are duplicative.

    If you choose to merge the duplicative category combinations, you would need to 
    remap all category option combinations from the category combo which you wish to 
    remove, to the one which you wish to keep. 

    If one of the categories is not in use in any category combination, it should
    consider to be removed from the system.
