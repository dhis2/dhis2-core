  SELECT count(*) AS count FROM categoryoptioncombo
  WHERE name = 'default' AND uid != 'HllvX50cXC0';

  SELECT uid, name FROM categoryoptioncombo
  WHERE name = 'default' AND uid != 'HllvX50cXC0'

severity: SEVERE
introduction: >
  There should only exist one category option with name and code "default".
recommendation: >
  Only the category option combo with UID "HllvX50cXC0" should be named "default" and have code "default".
  Either rename the conflicting category option combo or move all references to category option combo "HllvX50cXC0"
  and then remove the unused conflicting category option combo.
