section_order: 4
summary_uid: GmX5ZiyrlCL

recommendation: >
  Only the category option combo with UID "HllvX50cXC0" should be named "default" and have code "default".
  Either rename the conflicting category option combo or move all references to category option combo "HllvX50cXC0"
  and then remove the unused conflicting category option combo.
