  SELECT count(*) AS count FROM categorycombo
  WHERE name = 'default' AND uid != 'bjDvmb4bfuf';

  SELECT uid, name FROM categorycombo
  WHERE name = 'default' AND uid != 'bjDvmb4bfuf'

severity: SEVERE
introduction: >
  There should only exist one category combo with name and code "default".
recommendation: >
  Only the category combo with UID "bjDvmb4bfuf" should be named "default" and have code "default".
  Either rename the conflicting category combo or move all references to category combo "bjDvmb4bfuf"
  and then remove the unused conflicting category combo.
