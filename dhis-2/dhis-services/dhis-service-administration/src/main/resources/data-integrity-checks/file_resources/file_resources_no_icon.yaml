  SELECT count(*) FROM fileresource f

details_id_type: fileResources
severity: SEVERE
introduction: >
  A file resource of type ICON should always have a corresponding icon entry.
recommendation: >
  If the missing icon belongs to a default (system) icon delete the file resource manually.
  The icon will be recreated automatically.
  If the missing icon is a custom (user provided) icon there are two options:
  1. repair the icon by manually creating the icon entry linked to the existing file resource
  2. discard the icon completely by deleting the file resource manually (image can not be recovered)
