introduction: >
  A file resource of type ICON should always have a corresponding icon entry.
recommendation: >
  The easiest solution is to delete the file resource and re-add the icon anew if it is still needed.
  If the file resource is of unknown origin and should be kept a corresponding icon entry needs to be
  created manually. This likely requires SQL level access as usually icon and file resource are 
  maintained together when using the API.
