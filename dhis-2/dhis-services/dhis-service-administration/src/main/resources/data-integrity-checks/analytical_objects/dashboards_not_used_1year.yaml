  severity: WARNING
  introduction: >
    Dashboards should be regularly viewed in the system. In many cases, users may create dashboards for
    temporary purposes and then never delete them. This can eventually lead to a lack of tidiness
    in the system. This can lead to useful dashboards being difficult to find. This
    check identifies any dashboards which have not been viewed in the past year.
  details_id_type: dashboards
  recommendation: >
    Unused dashboards can be deleted in the entirety from the main dashboard app by clicking on the "Edit" 
    button and choosing "Delete". Note that this process cannot be undone! Another option would be to alter
    the sharing of the dashboard so that it is not visible to any user.
