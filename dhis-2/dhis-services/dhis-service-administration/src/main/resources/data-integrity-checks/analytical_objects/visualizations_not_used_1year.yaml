  severity: WARNING
  introduction: >
    Visualizations should be regularly viewed in the system. In many cases, users may create charts for
    temporary purposes and then never delete them. This can eventually lead to a lack of tidiness
    in the system. This can lead to charts being difficult to find in the visualization app.
  details_id_type: visualizations
  recommendation: >
    Unused charts can be removed directly using the data visualization app by a user with sufficient
    authority. If charts are a part of any dashboard however, they will also need to be removed
    from the dashboard first.
