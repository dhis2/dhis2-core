    SELECT COUNT(*) as value,
    100 * COUNT(*) / NULLIF( (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pushanalysis), 0) as percent
    from pushanalysis where pushanalysisid NOT IN

severity: WARNING
introduction: >
  Push analyses should have recipients to be useful. Push analyses without recipients are not
  useful and should be reviewed. These push analyses may have been assigned to a set of
  recipients that no longer exists, or perhaps were created as a test and never assigned to
  any recipients.
details_id_type: pushAnalysis
recommendation: >
  Using the records contained in the integrity details, review the push analyses with no 
  user group recipients. Either assign the push analysis to a user group, or consider to  delete the push
    analysis if it is no longer needed.
