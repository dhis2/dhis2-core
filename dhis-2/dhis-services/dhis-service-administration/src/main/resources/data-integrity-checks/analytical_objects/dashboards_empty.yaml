  introduction: >
    All dashboards should have content on them. Dashboards without any content do not 
    serve any purpose, and can make it more difficult to find relevant dashboards with content.
  details_id_type: dashboards
  recommendation: >
    Dashboards without content that have not been modified in the last 14 days should
    be considered for deletion.
