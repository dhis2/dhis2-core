introduction: >
  Single event cannot be scheduled, hence occurred date is mandatory. This was enforced by the system
  but it is not enforced in the database. Starting from v43, the occurred date column for single events
  will not accept null values. This check must pass in order to be able to upgrade to v43 and later.
details_id_type: events
recommendation: >-
  You will need to either assign an occurred date to the single event or delete the single event.
  
  One way it so try to assign to occurreddate column a value getting it from scheduleddate or completeddate
  or a manually inserted value:
  
  UPDATE singleevent
  SET occurreddate = COALESCE(event.scheduleddate, event.completeddate, '2025-09-01 11:26:00')
  WHERE uid = '<event_uid>';
     
  Be sure to replace `<event_uid>` with the UID of the single event you want to fix.
  As is always the case with direct database manipulation, you should
  ensure that you have a backup of your database before running this command, 
  ensure that DHIS2 is not running, perform the change in a test environment first. 
  
  After linking fixing the single event, 
  restart DHIS2 and re-run the integrity check to ensure that the single event has an occurred date
  and the integrity check no longer flags it.
  
  Alternatively, if you know that the event is not needed or used, you can delete it.
  You can delete the single event using the following SQL command:
  
  UPDATE event SET deleted = true WHERE uid = '<event_uid>';
    
  Replace `<event_uid>` with the UID of the single event you want to delete. 
  Once you have run this command return to the Data Administration app and choose "Maintenance" 
  and then tick "Permanently remove soft deleted events". Click "Perform maintenance" to 
  permanently delete the soft-deleted events.
  
  If you are unsure how to proceed or encounter issues when either trying to fix or delete a single event, 
  please feel free to reach out on the DHIS2 Community of Practice forum at https://community.dhis2.org.
