description: Program indicators without an expression.

  WITH program_indicators_no_expression as (
  SELECT uid,name from programindicator where expression IS NULL)
  SELECT COUNT(*) as value,
  100.0 * COUNT(*) / NULLIF( (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM programindicator),0) as percent

  where expression IS NULL
  GROUP BY a.uid,a.name;
severity: SEVERE
introduction: >
  Program indicators should always have a defined expression. If they do not have a defined
  expression, no value will able to be calculated for them and they will always return 
  an empty value.
details_id_type: programIndicators
recommendation: >
  For each program indicator which does not have an expression, assign an expression
  using the DHIS2 user interface. Alternatively, if the program indicator is not in use,
  then consider to remove it.
