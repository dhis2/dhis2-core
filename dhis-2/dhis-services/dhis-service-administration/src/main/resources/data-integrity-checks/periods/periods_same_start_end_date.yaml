  severity: CRITICAL
  introduction: >
    Different periods should not have exactly the same start and end date.
  details_id_type: periods
  recommendation: >
    All references to the duplicate periods should be removed from the system and
    reassigned. It is recommended to use the period with the lower periodid.
