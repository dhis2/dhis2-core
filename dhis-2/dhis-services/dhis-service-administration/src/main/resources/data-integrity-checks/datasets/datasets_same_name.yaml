severity: WARNING
introduction: >
  While datasets are not required to have unique names, it is generally a good idea to avoid having datasets 
  with the same name or short name. This can lead to confusion and make it difficult to distinguish between datasets.
details_id_type: dataSets
recommendation: >
    Consider renaming datasets with the same name or short name to make it easier to distinguish between them.
