introduction: >
    Option sets contain options which should be ordered sequentially. The sort_order property should always start 
    with 1 and have a sequential sequence. If there are three options in the option set, then the sort order
    should be 1,2,3. 
    
    In certain circumstances, options may be deleted from an option set, and the sort
    order may become corrupted. This may lead to a situation where it becomes impossible to update the
    option set from the maintenance app, and may lead to problems when attempting to using the option
    set in the data entry app.
recommendation: >
    If it is possible to open the option set in the maintenance app, you can resort the option set,
    which should correct the problem. Another possible solution is to directly update the sort_order
    property of in the `optionset` table in the database, ensuring that a valid sequence is present
    for all options in the option set.
