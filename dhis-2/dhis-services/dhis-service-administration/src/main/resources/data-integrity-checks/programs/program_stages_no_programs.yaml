introduction: >
  All program stages should be associated with a program. This check identifies
  program stages that are not linked to any program. Certain version of DHIS2
  do now allow program stages to exist without being linked to a program and may
  result in the system not being able to start.
details_id_type: programStages
recommendation: >
  You will need to either delete the program stage or link it to a program.
  Currently, the only feasible way to link a program stage to a program is
  to alter the `programid` field in the `programstage` table in the database.
  Choose a program that is suitable for the program stage and run the following SQL command:
  ```sql
    UPDATE programstage SET programid = '<program_id>' WHERE uid = '<program_stage_uid>';
  ```
  
  Obviously, as is always the case with direct database manipulation, you should
  ensure that you have a backup of your database before running this command, perform
  the change in a test environment first, and ensure that the system functions as expected after the change.
  
  Alternatively, if the program stage is not needed, you can delete it using the following SQL command:
  ```sql
    DELETE FROM programstage WHERE uid = '<program_stage_uid>';
  ```
  
  Note that any data or enrollments associated with the program stage will also be deleted.
  Ensure that you have a backup of your database before running this command,
  and perform the change in a test environment first.
