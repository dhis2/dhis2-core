severity: SEVERE
introduction: >
  The TRACKER_ASSOCIATE value type is deprecated and will be no longer supported in DHIS2 from v43.
  This check identifies data elements and tracked entity attributes that
  still use this deprecated value type. Having elements with TRACKER_ASSOCIATE
  value type will block the upgrade to version v43.
details_id_type: dataElements
recommendation: >-
  You will need to either delete the data elements or tracked entity attributes
  flagged by this check or change their value type to a supported type.

  If you want to change the value type, you can do so through the DHIS2 UI
  in the Maintenance app. Navigate to the data element or tracked entity attribute
  and change its value type to a supported type such as TEXT, NUMBER, or another
  appropriate value type based on your data requirements.

  Alternatively, you can update the value type directly in the database.
  To change a data element's value type, use:

  UPDATE dataelement SET valuetype = '<new_value_type>'
  WHERE uid = '<data_element_uid>';

  To change a tracked entity attribute's value type, use:

  UPDATE trackedentityattribute SET valuetype = '<new_value_type>'
  WHERE uid = '<tracked_entity_attribute_uid>';

  Be sure to replace `<new_value_type>` with an appropriate value type
  (such as 'TEXT', 'NUMBER', etc.) and `<data_element_uid>` or
  `<tracked_entity_attribute_uid>` with the UID of the element you want to update.

  As always with direct database manipulation, ensure you have a backup
  of your database before running these commands, ensure DHIS2 is not running,
  and perform the change in a test environment first.

  If the data element or tracked entity attribute is not needed, you can delete it
  through the Maintenance app or via the API.

  After making changes, restart DHIS2 and re-run this integrity check to ensure
  the TRACKER_ASSOCIATE value types have been resolved.

  If you are unsure how to proceed or encounter issues, please reach out
  on the DHIS2 Community of Practice forum at https://community.dhis2.org.
