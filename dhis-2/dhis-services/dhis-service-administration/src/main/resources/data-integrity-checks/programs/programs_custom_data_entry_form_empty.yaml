severity: WARNING
introduction: >
  Custom data entry forms can be created with HTML code to provide 
  a richer data entry experience for users. This check identifies
  any program stages which have custom data entry forms that are empty. This 
  may cause issues during data entry.
details_id_type: programs
recommendation: >
  If the program stage, or event program, should have a custom data entry form, be sure to
  populate the HTML code field in the data entry form. If the program stage or event program
  should not have a custom data entry form, you should assign delete
  the empty custom form and create an appropriate form instead.
