severity: WARNING
introduction: >
  Geometry data in DHIS2 is expected to use the standard WGS 84 coordinate system (SRID 4326).
  Records in the trackedentity, enrollment, or event tables using a different spatial reference
  system may cause issues in GIS-based features. This integrity check identifies such records.
details_id_type: tracker
recommendation: >-
  To correct this issue, you should update the SRID of the affected records to 4326 using the following SQL queries.
  Make sure the geometries are already in the correct coordinate system (WGS 84); this operation only resets the SRID metadata:
  
    UPDATE trackedentity
    SET geometry = ST_SetSRID(geometry, 4326)
    WHERE geometry IS NOT NULL AND ST_SRID(geometry) != 4326;

    UPDATE enrollment
    SET geometry = ST_SetSRID(geometry, 4326)
    WHERE geometry IS NOT NULL AND ST_SRID(geometry) != 4326;

    UPDATE event
    SET geometry = ST_SetSRID(geometry, 4326)
    WHERE geometry IS NOT NULL AND ST_SRID(geometry) != 4326;

  It is highly recommended to back up your database before applying these changes and test in a staging environment first.
