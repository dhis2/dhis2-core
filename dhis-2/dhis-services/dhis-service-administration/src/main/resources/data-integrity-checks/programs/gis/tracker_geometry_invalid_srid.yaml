introduction: >
  Geometry data in DHIS2 should conform to the WGS 84 coordinate system (SRID 4326).
  Tracker records (Tracked Entity, Enrollment, or Event) using a different spatial reference system
  may lead to unexpected results or errors in GIS-based features. This integrity check identifies
  such geometry records that do not use SRID 4326.

recommendation: >-
  To correct this issue, update the SRID of the affected records to 4326 using the SQL queries below:

    UPDATE trackedentity
    SET geometry = ST_SetSRID(geometry, 4326)
    WHERE geometry IS NOT NULL AND ST_SRID(geometry) != 4326;

    UPDATE enrollment
    SET geometry = ST_SetSRID(geometry, 4326)
    WHERE geometry IS NOT NULL AND ST_SRID(geometry) != 4326;

    UPDATE event
    SET geometry = ST_SetSRID(geometry, 4326)
    WHERE geometry IS NOT NULL AND ST_SRID(geometry) != 4326;

  Make sure to back up your database and run this fix in a testing or staging environment before applying to production.
