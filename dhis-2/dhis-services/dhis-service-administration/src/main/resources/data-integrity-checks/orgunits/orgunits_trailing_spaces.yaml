description: Organisation units should not have trailing spaces.
section: Organisation units

  WITH orgunits_trailing_spaces as (
  SELECT uid, name from organisationunit where name ~('\s+$') OR shortname ~('\s+$')

  SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as value,
  100 * COUNT(*) / NULLIF( (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organisationunit), 0)  as percent

severity: WARNING
introduction: >
  Trailing spaces in organisation units are superfluous.
recommendation: >
  If the number of affected organisation units is small, the easiest remedy is to correct
  them directly from the user interface. Another possible option would be to replace
  all of the trailing spaces using SQL.
