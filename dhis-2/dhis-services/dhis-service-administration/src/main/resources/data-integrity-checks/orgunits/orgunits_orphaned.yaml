severity: CRITICAL
introduction: >
  Orphaned organisation units are those which have neither parents nor any children.
  This means that they have no relationship to the main organisation unit hierarchy.
  These may be created by faulty metadata imports or direct manipulation of the database.
recommendation: >
  The orphaned organisation units should be assigned a parent or removed from the system.
  It is recommended to use the DHIS2 API for this task if possible. If this is not possible,
  then they may need to be removed through direct SQL on the DHIS2 database.
