severity: SEVERE
introduction: >
    If any organisation unit groups have been marked as compulsory, each and every organisation unit should
    belong to exactly one group within each compulsory organisation unit group set. Assume we have created a 
    group set called "Ownership" with two groups "Public" and "Private". Each and every organisation
    unit contained in the hierarchy must belong to either Public or Private (but not both). When organisation 
    unit are not part of a group set, results in the analytics apps will not be correct if the organisation 
    unit group set is used for aggregation.
recommendation: >
    For each of the organisation units identified in the details query, you should assign the appropriate
    organisation unit group within the group set. Alternatively, if the group set should not be compulsory, 
    you should change this attribute.
