severity: SEVERE
introduction: >
  Any organisation unit groups which have been marked as compulsory should
  contain all organization units in the system. If certain organization units
  are omitted from the groups in the group set, this may cause irregularities
  in analytical outputs, such as data being omitted.
recommendation: >
  Add all organization units to exactly one group within a compulsory organization unit
  group.
