introduction: |
  All organisation units should usually belong to at least one organisation unit group.
  When organisation units do not belong to any groups, they become more difficult to identify
  in analysis apps like the data visualizer.
recommendation: |
  Create useful organisation unit groups to help users filter certain classes of organisation
  units. These groups may or may not be used in organisation unit group sets
