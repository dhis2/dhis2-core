severity: CRITICAL
introduction: >
  Every DHIS2 system should have a single root organisation unit. This means a single organisation
  unit from which all other branches of the hierarchy are descendants.
recommendation: >
  Once you have decided which organisation unit should be the real root of the organisation
  unit hierarchy, you should update the parent organisation unit. This can be done by using
  the DHIS2 API or my updating the value directly in the `organisationunit` table.
