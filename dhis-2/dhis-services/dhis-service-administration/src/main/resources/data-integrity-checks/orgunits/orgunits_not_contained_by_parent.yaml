introduction: >
  Facilities are often represented as points in the DHIS2 hierarchy. Their parent organisation units
  geometry should contain all facilities which have been associated with them.

recommendation: |
  Often boundary files are simplified when they are uploaded into DHIS2. This process may result in
  facilities which are located close to the border of a given district to fall outside of the district
  when the boundary is simplified. This is considered to be more of a cosmetic problem for most DHIS2
  installations, but could become an issue if any geospatial analysis is attempted using the
  boundaries and point coordinates.
  
  In cases where the facility falls outside of its parent's boundary
  you should confirm that the coordinates are correct. If the location is close to the boundary, you
  may want to reconsider how the boundary files have been simplified. Otherwise, if the location of
  the facility is completely incorrect, it should be rectified.
