severity: SEVERE
introduction: >
  Organisation units should belong to exactly one group within each organisation
  unit group set of which they are a member. If the organisation unit belongs to
  multiple groups, this will lead to unpredictable results in analysis.
recommendation: >
  Using the maintenance app, assign the organisation units in the details list
  to exactly one group within each group set membership.
