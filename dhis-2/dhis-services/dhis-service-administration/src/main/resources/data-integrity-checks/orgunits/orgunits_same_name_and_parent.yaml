severity: WARNING
introduction: >
  Organisation units may have exactly the same name. This may become confusing to users,
  particularly if the organisation unit has the same name and same parent. This can easily
  lead to data entry or analysis mistakes as users have no way to distinguish between the 
  two organisation units.
recommendation: >
  Rename identically named organisation units which share the same parent using the 
  maintenance app.
