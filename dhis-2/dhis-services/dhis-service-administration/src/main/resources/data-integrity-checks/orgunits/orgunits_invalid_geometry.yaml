introduction: |
  DHIS2 uses the PostGIS database extension to manage the geographical information associated
  with organisation units. There are various reasons why geometries may be considered to be
  invalid including self-inclusions, self-intersections, and sliver polygons. Please see the
  PostGIS documentation for a more in-depth discussion on this topic.
  
  Invalid geometry is not always a problem and may be able to be ignored, however, it has been observed in certain systems
  that this can lead to problems in analytics. If you are experiencing issues when generating analytics
  tables, and see errors related to invalid geometries, you will need to either remove the invalid geometry,
  or fix it.
recommendation: >
  Update the geometry of the affected organisation units to a valid geometry. It may be possible
  to use the PostGIS function `ST_MakeValid` to automatically fix the problem. However, in other
  cases the geometry may need to be edited in a GIS tool, and then updated again in DHIS2.
