introduction: |
  Ideally, all organisation units contained in the DHIS2 hierarchy should have a valid
  set of coordinates. Usually for all organisation units above the facility level,
  these coordinates should be a polygon which provides the boundary of the organisation
  unit. For facilities, these are usually represented as  point coordinates.
  
  There can obviously be exceptions to this rule. Mobile health facilities may not have
  a fixed location. Community health workers or wards below the facility level
  may also not have a defined or definable coordinate.
  
  This check is intended to allow you to review all organisation units which do
  not have any coordinates and make a determination as to whether they should be updated.

recommendation: |
  Where appropriate, update the geometry of each organisation unit with a valid geometry.
  You may need to contact the appropriate local government office to obtain a copy
  of district boundaries, commonly referred to as "shape files". Another possibility
  is to use freely available boundary files from GADM (https://gadm.org)
  
  If facilities are missing coordinates, it may be possible to obtain these from
  the facility staff using their smart phone to get the coordinates. Images
  from Google Maps can also often be used to estimate the position of a facility,
  assuming that you have good enough resolution and local knowledge of where
  it is located.
