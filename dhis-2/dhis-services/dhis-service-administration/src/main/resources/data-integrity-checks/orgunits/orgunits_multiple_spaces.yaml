description: Organisation units should not have multiple spaces in their names or shortnames.
section: Organisation units
section_order: 6
summary_sql: >-
  WITH orgunits_multiple_spaces as (
  SELECT uid, name from organisationunit 
  where name ~('\s{2,}') OR shortname ~('\s{2,}')
  )
  SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as value,
  100 * COUNT(*) / NULLIF( (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organisationunit), 0) as percent

  SELECT uid, name, shortname as comment from organisationunit 
  where name ~('\s{2,}') OR shortname ~('\s{2,}');
details_id_type: organisationUnits
severity: WARNING
introduction: >
  Names and/or shortnames of organisation units should not contain multiple spaces. They are superfluous
  and may complicate the location of organisation units when they are searched.
recommendation: >
  If the number of affected organisation units is small, the easiest remedy is to correct
  them directly from the user interface. Another possible option would be to replace
  all of the multiple spaces using SQL.
