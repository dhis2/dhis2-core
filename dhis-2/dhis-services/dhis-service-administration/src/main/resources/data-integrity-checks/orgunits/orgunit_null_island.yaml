introduction: >
  A common problem when importing coordinates is the inclusion of coordinates situated around
  the point of [Null Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island). This is the point
  on the Earth's surface where the Prime Meridian and Equator intersect with a latitude of 0
  and a longitude of 0. The point also happens to be situated currently in the middle of the
  ocean. This query identifies any points located within 100 km of the point having latitude
  and longitude equal to zero.
recommendation:
  Update the coordinates of the affected organization unit to the correct location.
