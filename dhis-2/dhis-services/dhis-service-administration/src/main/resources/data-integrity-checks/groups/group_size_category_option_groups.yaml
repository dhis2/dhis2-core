severity: WARNING
introduction: >
  Generally, category option groups should be composed of at least two category options. There can however
  be legitimate cases when a single category option is part of a group, especially in cases where 
  there is a direct mapping between age bands and category options.
recommendation: >
  Considering removing groups with zero or one category options, or alternatively, add additional
  category options to the group to make it more useful.
