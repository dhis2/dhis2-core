    select count(*) as value,
    100*count(*)/ NULLIF( (select count(*) from indicator), 0) as percent
    from indicator where indicatorid
    not in (select indicatorid from indicatorgroupmembers);

severity: WARNING
introduction: >
    All indicators should be in an indicator group. This allows users to find the indicators 
    more easily in analysis apps and also contributes to having more complete indicators
    group sets. Maintenance operations can also be made more efficient by applying bulk
    settings (ex. sharing, filtering) to all indicators within an indicator group.
details_id_type: indicators
recommendation: >
    Indicators that are not in a indicator group should be added to a relevant indicator group.
    If the indicators are not needed, they should be deleted.
