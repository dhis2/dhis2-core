severity: WARNING
introduction: >
    Indicators should generally have unique formulas. This metadata check attempts
    to identify indicators with the same formulas, regardless of the order of their 
    their terms. Suppose you have an indicator which calculates total ANC attendance:
    ANC Total = ANC1 + ANC2 + ANC3
    Suppose then another indicator exists in the system, which has been defined as: 
    ANC Totals = ANC3 + ANC2 + ANC1
    These two indicators are equivalent, and will produce the same result, and are thus
    considered to be duplicated.
recommendation: >
    Duplicative indicators should be considered to be removed from the system, since
    they may cause confusion on the part of users as to which one should be used. 
    Considered deleting all but one of the duplicated indicators using the maintenance
    app.
