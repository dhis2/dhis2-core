severity: WARNING
introduction: >
    Indicators should generally have unique formulas. This metadata check shows 
    indicators which have the exact same formulas. Spaces which are present are
    removed prior to comparison.
recommendation: >
    Duplicative indicators should be considered to be removed from the system, since
    they may cause confusion on the part of users as to which one should be used. 
    Consider deleting all but one of the duplicated indicators using the maintenance
    app.
