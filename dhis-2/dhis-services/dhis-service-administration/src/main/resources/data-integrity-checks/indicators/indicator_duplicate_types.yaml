severity: WARNING
introduction: Indicators can be assigned a factor which is multiplied by the 
    indicator's value. For example, if you create a percentage
    based indicator, you can assign the indicator a factor of 100, which would
    be multiplied by the actual value of the indicator calculated by DHIS2.
    In general, having multiple indicator types with the same factor is not
    recommended. It is duplicative, and may lead to confusion.
details_id_type: indicatorTypes
recommendation: Duplicated indicator types should consider to be removed
    from the system. Consider choosing one of the duplicated indicator types
    as the one to keep, and then update all indicators which share the same
    factor to this indicator type. The duplicated indicator types can then
    be removed from the system.
