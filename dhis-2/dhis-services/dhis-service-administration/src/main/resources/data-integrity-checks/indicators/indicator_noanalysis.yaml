introduction: >
    Indicators should be used to produce some type of analytical output (charts, maps, pivot tables).
    Note: indicators used in datasets to provide feedback during data entry are not counted
    as being used in analytical objects.
details_id_type: indicators
recommendation: >
    Indicators that are not routinely being used for analysis should be reviewed to
    determine if they are useful and needed. If these are meant to be used for routine 
    review, then associated outputs should be created using them. If these indicators are
    not going to be used for any type of information review, and are not used in data sets
    for feedback during data entry, consideration should be made to delete them.
