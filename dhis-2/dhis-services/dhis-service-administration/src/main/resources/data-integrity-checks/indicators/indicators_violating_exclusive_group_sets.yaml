severity: WARNING
introduction: >
    Indicators should belong to exactly one group within each indicator
    group set of which they are a member.
details_id_type: indicators
recommendation: >
    Indicators that belong to multiple groups should be removed from all but one
    of the groups within the group set. If the indicator or indicator group is 
    not needed, consider to remove them.
