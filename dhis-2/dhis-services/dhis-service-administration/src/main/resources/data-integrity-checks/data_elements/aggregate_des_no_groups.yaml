   SELECT COUNT(*) as value,
    100*COUNT(*)/ NULLIF( (SELECT COUNT(*) from dataelement where domaintype = 'AGGREGATE'), 0) as percent

  severity: WARNING
  introduction: >
    All data elements should be in a data element group.
    This allows users to find the data elements more easily in analysis
     apps and also contributes to having more complete data element group sets.
     Maintenance operations can also be made more efficient by applying
     bulk settings (ex. sharing) to all data elements within a data element group.
  details_id_type: dataElements
  recommendation: >
    Data elements that are not in a data element group should be added to a relevant
    data element group. If the data elements are not needed, they should be deleted.
