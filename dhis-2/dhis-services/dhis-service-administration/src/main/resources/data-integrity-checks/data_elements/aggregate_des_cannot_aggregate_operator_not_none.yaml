  severity: WARNING
  introduction: >
    Aggregate domain data elements which cannot be aggregated should have their aggregation operator set to NONE.
    If the aggregation operator is set to something other than NONE, this may lead to unexpected results
    in the analytics modules.
  recommendation: >
    Open the affected data elements in the Maintenance App and change their aggregation type
    to NONE. Alternatively, these can be altered via the API.
