severity: WARNING
introduction: >
    Data elements should generally always be associated with data values.
    If data elements exist in a data set which is active, but there are no
    data values associated with them, they may not be part of the data entry
    screens. Alternatively, the data element may have been added but never
    been associated with a dataset.
recommendation: >
    Consider removing data elements with no data values.
