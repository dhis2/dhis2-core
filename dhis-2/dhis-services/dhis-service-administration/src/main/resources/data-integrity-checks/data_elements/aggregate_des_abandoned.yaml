  severity: WARNING
  introduction: >
    Data elements are considered to be abandoned when they have not been edited in at least 100 days
    and do not have any data values associated with them. Often, these are the result of new or changed
    configurations that have been abandoned at some point.
  recommendation: >
    Data elements that have no data associated with them and which there are no plans
    to start using for data collection should be deleted.
