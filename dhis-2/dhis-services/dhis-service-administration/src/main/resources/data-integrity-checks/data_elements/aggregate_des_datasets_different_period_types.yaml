  severity: SEVERE
  introduction: >
    Data elements should not belong to datasets with different period types.
  details_id_type: dataElements
  recommendation: >
    If you need to collect data with different period types (e.g. weekly and monthly) you should
    use different data elements for each period type. In general, it is not recommended to 
    collect data with different frequencies, since in general, data collected at higher frequencies (e.g. weekly)
    can be aggregated to data with lower frequencies (e.g yearly).
