  severity: WARNING
  introduction: >
    Data elements which are not numeric (text, dates, etc) should have an aggregation
    operator set to NONE. Data elements which are able to be aggregated (numbers, integers, etc) 
    should have an aggregation operator set to something other than NONE, most often SUM.
  recommendation: >
    Open the affected data elements in the Maintenance App and change their aggregation type
    to an appropriate type. Alternatively, these can be altered via the API.
