  severity: WARNING
  introduction: >
    Aggregate domain data elements which can be aggregated should have their aggregation operator set to some 
    aggregation operator other than NONE.
    If the aggregation operator is set to  NONE, this may lead to unexpected results
    in the analytics modules.
  recommendation: >
    Open the affected data elements in the Maintenance App and change their aggregation type
    to an appropriate type, such as SUM. Alternatively, these can be altered via the API.
