introduction: >
    All validation rules should belong to a validation rule group. Validation rule groups
    help to define subsets of validation rules which can be run selectively in the 
    data quality module. Having validation rules grouped appropriately ensures 
    that users are able to perform a validation rule analysis of an appropriate group
    of rules, without having to run all of them.
recommendation: >
    If you have not already done so, create validation rule groups and assign all 
    validation rules to a group.
