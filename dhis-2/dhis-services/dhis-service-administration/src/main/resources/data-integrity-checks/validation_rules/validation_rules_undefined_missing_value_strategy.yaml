description: All validation rule expressions should have a missing value strategy.
section: Validation rules
section_order: 1
summary_sql: >-
    SELECT COUNT(*) as value,
    100.0 * count(*) / NULLIF( (select count(*) from expression), 0)  as percent
    from expression where missingvaluestrategy IS NULL;

    SELECT a.uid,a.name,'LHS' as comment
    from validationrule a
    INNER JOIN expression b on a.leftexpressionid = b.expressionid
    where b.missingvaluestrategy IS NULL;
details_id_type: validationRules
severity: SEVERE
introduction: >
    Validation rules are composed of a left and right side expression. In certain systems
    the missing value strategy may not be defined. This may lead to an exception during
    validation rule analysis. The affected validation rules should be corrected to
    with an appropriate missing value strategy.
recommendation: >
    Using the results of the the details SQL view, identify the affected validation rules
    and which side of the rule the missing value strategy has not been specified. Using the
    maintenance app, make the appropriate corrections and save the rule.
