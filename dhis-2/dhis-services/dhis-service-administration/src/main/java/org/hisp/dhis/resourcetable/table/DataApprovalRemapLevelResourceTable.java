/**
 * Remaps approval levels within a workflow for analytics tables approved
 * data visibility. This handles the case where a workflow does not include
 * all data approval levels. Where approval levels are skipped by the workflow,
 * they are remapped upwords so that higher-level users can see the approved
 * data.
 * <p/>
 * For example, if a workfow includes approval levels 1,2,4, and 5, the approved
 * data will be tagged at levels 1,2,3, and 5. This allows level 2 users to see
 * data in this workflow that is approved at level 4.
 * <p/>
 * As another example, if a workflow includes levels 3,4,5, and 7, the approved
 * data will be tagged at levels 1,4,5, and 6. This allows level 1 users to see
 * level 3 approved data, and level 5 users to see level 7 approved data.
