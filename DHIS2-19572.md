# DHIS2-19572

Analyzing tracker request logs from nginx.

## Run Locally

### Generate And Analyze

To analyze requests made to tracker APIs locally and search through them in Kibana

- create `.env`

```sh
ELASTIC_PASSWORD=yourwelcome
KIBANA_PASSWORD=yourwelcome
# Version of Elastic products
STACK_VERSION=9.0.1
CLUSTER_NAME=docker-cluster
LICENSE=basic
ES_PORT=9200
#ES_PORT=127.0.0.1:9200
KIBANA_PORT=5601
# Increase or decrease based on the available host memory (in bytes)
MEM_LIMIT=1073741824
```

- start all services

```sh
docker compose --profile dhis2 --profile ingest --profile analyze up
```

- make requests to tracker either via an app like Capture, Import/Export or any other client
- login to Kibana

http://localhost:5601/app

using user `elastic` and the password you set in the .env file

- discover logs for index `tracker-local`

### Analyze

Starting the ELK stack is enough if all you only want to analyze data you have already indexed

```sh
docker compose --profile analyze up
```

### Clean data

If you changed the nginx log format and want to start fresh you can stop the nginx and vector
containers and delete the volume which stores the nginx logs (or delete the file in it).

```sh
docker compose rm -sf nginx vector
docker volume rm core_nginx-logs
```

Then delete the elasticsearch index

http://localhost:5601/app/management/data/index_management/indices

and start nginx and vector again.

### Troubleshooting

Elasticsearch might fail to start due to this error

https://discuss.elastic.co/t/eck-elasticsearch-pod-not-starting-on-aks-max-virtual-memory-areas-vm-max-map-count-65530-is-too-low-increase-to-at-least-262144/305788

Apply the suggested fix

```sh
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

## Nginx Config

Test the nginx config

```sh
docker compose exec nginx nginx -t
```

Reload the nginx config

```sh
docker compose exec nginx nginx -s reload
```

Stream tracker request logs

```sh
docker compose exec nginx tail -f /var/log/nginx/tracker_access.log
```

Copy tracker request logs

```sh
docker compose cp nginx:/var/log/nginx/tracker_access.log ~/code/dhis2/tracker_access.log
```

## Vector Config

Restart vector if you change its config

```sh
docker compose restart vector
```

Vector does have `--watch-config` but I prefer the explicit reload for this use case.

### Access log pattern

nginx does not support logging as JSON well. There are some workarounds but in order to not put any
extra load or odd logic into implementations nginx configurtations we opted to log using a custom
csv parsable pattern. The separator `|` is used as its unlikely part of any logged value.
